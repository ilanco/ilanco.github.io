## Preface

This is my first post. I mean my first post _ever_.

## Hi!

My name is Ilan Cohen. I'm 32, software developer and I have been living in Israel 
for the last 15 years. 

## Why I want to write?

Writing is not something that comes to me naturally. I remember myself struggling 
with essay assignments in school and college and basically never wrote anything 
again since. The task of transforming a piece of white paper into anything else than 
a paper airplane would require huge amounts of mental power.

I want to write because I feel like it. I want to write because I feel it will be liberating. 
I want to write because I have something to share.

## What am I going to write about?

Most posts will be technical. I'm a developer and I'd like to give back to the awesome 
community I've been leaning on my whole career. My first blog post after this one will 
probably be about how I created this blog and how you can create one too. Some posts 
will be personal. I'm going to have brain surgery in less than a week and I want to share 
my experience.

## Bye!

I would love to hear from you! Comment, tweet or mail me with any thoughts. My contact 
details are in the footer.
