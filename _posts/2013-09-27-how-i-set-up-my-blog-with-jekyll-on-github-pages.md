## Why Jekyll?

#### A guide
If you are not familiar with Jekyll:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory 
> (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid 
> converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or 
> your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use 
> to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.
